# LLM Router 

An intelligent LLM Router that automatically directs user prompts to the most cost-effective LLM based on task type and preference needs

## ✨ Features

- A routing function that classifies prompt types and sends them to the most cost effective LLM
- A web app that lets users test prompts and view model selection, latency, and cost per request

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- React  
- Next.js  
- JavaScript  
- REST APIs  
- LLM (Large Language Models)
